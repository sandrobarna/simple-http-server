Description:

This is a simple multithreaded HTTP web server.
It uses HTTP/1.1 and currently only supports HEAD and GET requests. Persistent connections aren't supported as well.

For downloading compiled program, please refer to the release section.


Building from the source:

1) Create a jar file using following maven command from terminal: mvn package
2) Go into newly created target folder and create config folder inside
3) Copy contents of src/main/resources into this config folder


Running a program:

You can start the server by simply running jar file from the terminal: java -jar file.jar
(In case of problems, try different port number in config/config.properties file)


Notes:

1) You will probably need to change server rootdir from the config. 
E.g. if you set it to /srv/http/ and put file example.html in there, then you can retrieve this 
file by making GET request on target: http://hostname:port/example.html (you must specify file, default index isn't supported)

2) You may see WARN log message saying 'IOException: Stream interrupted or empty.' which isn't a bug, it's just for the information.


Requirements:
JRE 8
